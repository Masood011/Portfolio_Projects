## WEB SCRAPING

<p> This repository showcases my journey as a data analyst exploring web scraping. I use Python and libraries like BeautifulSoup and Requests to extract, clean, and analyze data from websites. Web scraping is a hobby that helps me learn more about computers while having fun. This project demonstrates my technical skills and curiosity about how web technologies and data come together.
